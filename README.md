EDGE-AI: TinyML Activity Detection with Nicla VisionThis repository contains the complete workflow for the "Day 1 - TinyML" project, focusing on hardware setup, real-time data collection, and IMU sensor integration using the Arduino Nicla Vision.📂 Repository Structuredata/: Scripts for wireless data transmission (main.py) 1111and host-side collection/visualization22222222.docs/: Official datasheets and step-by-step setup guides33333333.examples/: Basic hardware tests including LED blinking, camera initialization, and IMU thresholding.results/: Visual outputs and logs from the data collection experiments.🛠️ Hardware Setup & Data CollectionTo collect high-quality IMU data for activity recognition, follow these steps:1. Network ConfigurationHotspot: Turn on your mobile hotspot and connect your PC to it4.IP Identification: Open your command prompt, run ipconfig, and record your PC's IPv4 address5555.Firmware Sync: Update main.py with your mobile hotspot SSID/Key and the PC's IP address666666666.2. Device DeploymentConnect the Nicla Vision to your PC via USB and open the OpenMV IDE7777.Upload main.py to the device8888.Once the green LED lights up, the board is successfully connected to the network and ready to transmit9.You may now disconnect the board from the PC and power it via a portable power bank10.3. Data AcquisitionRun receive_data.py in VS Code on your PC11111111.Enter the activity label when prompted (e.g., sit, walk, swing)12121212.Duration: Perform the activity for at least 2 minutes to ensure data integrity13.The script will automatically terminate and save a timestamped CSV to the imu_data/ folder141414141414141414.🛰️ Sensor Specifications (IMU)The project utilizes the onboard LSM6DSOX 6-axis IMU. Data is captured in the following format:Accelerometer: $A_x, A_y, A_z$ (G-Force)Gyroscope: $G_x, G_y, G_z$ (Degrees/sec)Timestamp: Milliseconds since device boot📋 PrerequisitesOpenMV IDEPython 3.xRequired Libraries: matplotlib, csv, socket
